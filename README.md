### Challenges and Difficulties Encoutered
A challenge was encourtered when creating an analysis based on Goal outcomes and needing to manually entered formulas. There was a lot of time spent in ensuring formulas were accurate throughout the goal groupings. 

### Results 

- The results in "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" chart show that May and June were successful launch months. It also shows that there were no canceled launches in October. 

- The results in "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart show that the percentage of successful play projects decreased as the goal amount increased. In alignment with this, the percentage of failed play projects increased as the goal amount decreased. There were no canceled projects.

- While the dataset provides a lot of interesting information, it does not include qualitative data that can help inform how projects were promoted or what was done to reach each goal. 

- While we reviewed successful, failed and canceled projects, it would be interesting to see if there are any trends with "live" projects.
